	<p>Hello my name is Anthony DiDonna. I am a recent graduate from UCF with a bachelors degree in Digital Media: Game Design. I've always had a 
	passion for video games and that ended up in trying to develop games. I started with learning programming and trying to learn all the different languages I could, 
	even if it was just the basics of them. I also delved in the area of 3D modeling and I really enjoyed that as well. I didn't want to limit myself to one area of the process 
	so I tried to learn every aspect there is about designing and developing video games to make them fun interactive experiences that people won't want to forget.
	
	
	</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<p>I am game developer who primarily utilizes Unreal Engine 4 throughout most of my projects. While I usually use Unreal Engine 4, I am also proficient in other Game Engines such as Unity. I primarily like to deal with technical art related things like shader/
	material creation and visual effects, but here is a full list of my skillset (work in progress).

	<ul>
	<li>Blueprint visual scripting language in Unreal Engine 4</li>
	<li>C# Programming language in Unity3D</li>
	<li>Master material creation</li>
	<li>Dynamic animated material creation</li>
	<li>Particle systems and Particle materials</li>
	<li>Lighting scenes</li>
	<li>Level building</li>
	<li>3D Asset creation</li>
	<li>3D Asset pipeline optimization and organization</li>
	</ul>
