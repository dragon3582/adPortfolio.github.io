	<a id="About Me" class="anchor" href="#About-Me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hello my name is Anthony DiDonna. Currently I am a student at UCF going for a bachelors degree in Digital Media on the Game Design track. I've always had a 
	passion for video games and that ended up in trying to develop games. I started with learning programming and trying to learn all the different languages I could, 
	even if it was just the basics of them. I also delved in the area of 3D modeling and I really enjoy that as well. I don't want to limit myself to one area of the process 
	so I plan to continue learning every aspect there is about designing and developing video games to make them fun interactive experiences that people won't want to forget.

	These are some 3D models I made. The program used to make the geometry and texture was Maya 2014, but some of the renders were done in Blender using LuxRender. Hover over the pictures to expand them.

	<p>
	This is a game that was made as a final project for one of my classes. It's a game made primarily in Javascript but also uses HTML DOM, CSS, and Canvas. Some of the images used I had just found on the internet. 
	(The game is made for use with a keyboard and mouse. Some things will not work if viewing from mobile devices.)

	This is a game that I am currently making with a couple other people. The name of the game is called Face-Off.
