	<a id="About Me" class="anchor" href="#About-Me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hello my name is Anthony DiDonna. Currently I am a student at UCF going for a bachelors degree in Digital Media on the Game Design track.
	I have had a passion for gaming ever since I had picked up a Sega Genesis and played Altered Beast for the first time. I've always had an interest in trying to develop
	games. The ways you can interact with games are nearly limitless. I started this path beginning with programming and trying to learn all 
	the different languages I could, even if it was just the basics of them. Some of those languages include C, C++, Javascript, and more. I also delved in the area 
	of 3D modeling and I really enjoy that as well. Later on I plan to get into trying to make animations for my 3D models, and then try my hand at writing a story for a game eventually. 
	I don't want to limit myself to one area of the process so I plan to continue learning everything there is about designing video games to make them fun 
	interactive experiences that people won't want to forget.

	These are some 3D models I made. The program used to make the geometry and texture was Maya 2014, but some of the renders were done in Blender using LuxRender.

	This is a game that was made as a final project for one of my classes. It's comprised of a mix of everything including HTML DOM, Javascript, CSS, and Canvas. Some of the images used I had just found on the internet.
