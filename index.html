	<p>
	This is a game that was made as a final project for one of my classes. It's a game made primarily in Javascript but also uses HTML DOM, CSS, and Canvas. Some of the images used I had just found on the internet. 
	(The game is made for use with a keyboard and mouse. Some things will not work if viewing from mobile devices.)

	<a id="game-in-dev" class="anchor" href="#game-in-dev" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Short video of a different game still being worked on.</h3>

	<p>
	This is a game that I am currently making with a couple other people. The name of the game is called Face-Off. 
	Most of the things that I did in this game was programming and putting it together inside the unity engine.
